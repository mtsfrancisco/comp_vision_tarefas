# Step 4. Sample the smoothed image at the places at which the maximal
# gradient-mask points. The gray-level values of the so-determined set of points are to
# be interpolated over the image. The interpolation process that is described in the
# sequel requires that all values on the border of the image also be supplied. We could
# either set the values at the border to the original image gray levels or supply
# somewhat higher values, making sure that the interpolation surface will be above the
# image surface near the border, so that no false objects will be detected there.
# However, it may happen that objects close to the image border are cut by the image frame. 
# Thus, supplying high border values would lead to total or partial loss of
# those objects. The solution chosen was to derive a one-dimensional gradient along
# the border line (like we do in two dimensions), seek for object boundaries there, and
# if such boundaries are found, sample the boundary values and 1-dimensionally and
# linearly interpolate them along the frame fine. Thus the border values are set as a
# result of a 1-dimensional segmentation process.
